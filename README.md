# lean-sdl-test

Run by doing

``lake exe lean-sdl-test``

This is a hard fork of [LeanDoomed](https://github.com/oOo0oOo/LeanDoomed) meant to show off the [Lean SDL3 bindings](https://github.com/ValorZard/lean-sdl-test)

IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS:
run ``lake exe lean-sdl-test`` on MSYS2. You may need to copy the binaries from the mingw bin folder into the bin folder for this project to get it to work.
